The world's dumbest node-red script, receives mttq msgs from the mailbox notifier, and also logs cabin indoor temperature.

The mailbox msgs trigger notification via Pushover app, and the temperature readings go to InfluxDB.  There is 
also the world's dumbest Grafana script that draws rough graphs for mailbox lora signal strength and battery level, 
and also the cabin temperature.
